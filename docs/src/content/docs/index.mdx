## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Security" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Your environment variables are encrypted using AES-128-GCM encryption
    algorithm. And passwords are never saved or cached anywhere. The encryption
    and decryption happens on the fly. So, you don't have to worry about your
    environment variables being exposed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unlimited Branches" icon="bars">
    You can create unlimited branches of your environment variables. For
    example, you can have a branch for staging, production, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unlimited Remote Repository" icon="laptop">
    You can have a git repo for personal projects, another for work, and another
    for your side projects. You can push and pull from any of these
    repositories. To learn more about this, check out the
    [Instance](/core-concepts/05-instance) page.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Goodbye dotenv" icon="pencil">
    And hello to less code, less dependencies, and less worries. Because with
    [pipe](/commands/04-pipe) command, you don't need to use dotenv and
    dotenv.config() or dotenv.load() in your code anymore.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customization" icon="setting">
    From default branch to default instance, from directory to .env filename
    patterns, you can customize everything. To learn more about this, check out
    the [Configuration](/envshh/configuration) page.
